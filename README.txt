The app opens on a screen with the prompt "Enter a US zip code:" with a line below and an Enter button on the bottom. The user must enter a valid US zip code and then click the Enter button. This takes the user to the second screen which displays a checkbox list of general clothing options and an Enter button. The user is supposed to check any items that they already own and click the Enter button. This takes the user to the third screen which displays: an icon for the current weather condition (cloudy, clear, rain, etc.); the high, low, and current temperatures; and our recommendation for a top, a bottom, and shoes. If the user has not checked an item of clothing on the previous screen, indicating they do not own it, and we are recommending it, the text of the recommended item is hyperlinked to an Amazon search of that item that the user can click on if they wish to browse and/or purchase it. To go back and enter a different zip code, the user must hit the back button twice so that they return to the first screen
